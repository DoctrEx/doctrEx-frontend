# DoctrEx

Doctrex focuses primarily on bridging the gap between patients and doctors;
bringing them all under one platform where the patients can consult with
doctors that suit them the best. Doctors will create their profile based on
their field of specialization and patients will be able to acquire consultation
from them. The platform will also serve as a community of patients and
doctors where the latter can post their queries and the former can help them
out in diagnosing the issues theyâ€™re dealing with. The payments cane be made
online as well as on-site depending on the consultation method determined
mutually. The platform will also provide personalized dashboards for the
users where they can monitor all their activities. In a nutshell, Doctrex will
revolutionize the way how the health care industry operates.
